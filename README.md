# when this game was coded-attempted to use the KISS,DRY and YAGNI 
# developer best practices

# Pseudo code 

# Defining instance variable:Human and Computer class

# Defining -Human choices -by using prompt function 
# limiting unusual takes of turns by humans

# Defining and displaying Computer choices with a Math.random function 

# comparing the choices of Human vis-a-vis Computers 
 # compare function was used 

 # comparing the results of humanChoice and computerChoice

 # challenges 
 # it was possible to play the game with a DOM by using 
 # document.write() function instead of console.log() ,but i found
   # out that it is not advisable to use the former function unless it is for
   # testing puposes -hence parcially my game is playing in the console

 # Improvements 
 # making the game more resposive and have a multiple rounds 
  # (by using functions such as setTimeout, addEventlistener...)
  # more work on the css and Html files(to make it more responsive and attractive)
